<p>One of our clients was confronted with an increasing workload in their procurement department and asked us to deliver a procurement and supplier-evaluation system. We designed, developed a procurement software <em>"e-procurement"</em> which carries out purchase orders in a fully automated tendering process and maintains the financial side of supplier-customer relationships.</p>

<h3 id="following-processes-were-covered">Following Processes were covered</h3>

<ul>
<li>Purchase orders, purchase requisitions, goods received and invoicing</li>
<li>Supplier Information, incl maintaining supplier information, contracts and catalogues</li>
<li>Suppliers / Vendor rating</li>

<li>Tendering, RFQ</li>
<li>Workflow engine that  checks and red flags to ensure that the procurement systems work seamlessly within the company</li>
</ul>

<p>Using an extensive API architecture we were able to implement the software in our client’s IT landscape, and the Procurement system is fully integrated with the company’s accounting and ERP software.</p>
