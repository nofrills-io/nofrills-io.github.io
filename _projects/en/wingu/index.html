<p>As part of the wingu core team we developed over the last 3 years an extensive  platform  and accompanied SDK's that enables developers to quickly and easily implement location features into mobile Apps and Web.  The  API service platform supports extensive proximity and data management and works in close connection with the advanced native (Swift / Kotlin) mobile SDKs. The wingu platform enables developers to create proximity triggers and location based content and interaction by only including the wingu SDK in their mobile app.</p>
