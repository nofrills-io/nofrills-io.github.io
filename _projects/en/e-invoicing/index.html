<p>One of our clients felt that his invoicing process, like many heavily paper-based processes, was manually intensive and prone to human errors,   resulting in increased costs and processing lifecycles. Togheter we designed, developed a software solution that runs the e-invoicing processes. It exchanges invoices between supplier and procurement in an integrated digital format. The automated, PO number based, workflow reduces invoice processing costs, increases efficiency and improves time-to-receive invoices. This module manages payments, receipts, authorisation and matching. Obviously, this must be highly secure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our solution saves costs â€“ as it results in faster payments and an increased accuracy.</li>
<li>Provides a company wide integration, it covers several api interfaces like a scan service, the accounting system and it brings together vendors and customers into a one stop portal / app.</li>
<li>Workflow engine that checks and red flags to ensure compliance. The workflow runs with as little human interaction as possible. And got after an extensive audit DIN approved.</li>
<li>Auditable trail for all transactions</li>
<li>API architecture allows future integrations</li>
</ul>

<p>We developed this solution in PHP, using a Service &amp; API architecture. The custom frontend uses Typescript and Webcomponents.</p>
