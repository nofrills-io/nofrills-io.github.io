<p>One of our international clients considered his visitor reception rather as a luxury. While the company wanted to maintain a professional and customer-friendly face  to visitors, they also needed to ensure that resources are employed effectively. Thus, in many cases the reception  was understaffed.</p>

<p>For this case we developed the e-reception. The solution is a self-service for visitors,  to sign themselves in and to inform the person they want to visit. It is intuitive, using a familiar Ipad interface, and it supports compliance, noticing who has been in the building and when. Our E- reception software can be customised trough a CMS and used for promotional and information purposes.</p>

<p>Our solution is easy to use as it is made for a broad range of users, from the postman to business visitors.
Always  up to date â€“ its connection to the calendar which shows the availability of employees and provide alternative contacts.
User- friendly, even though it is an application, it is still personal and friendly, reflecting a positive company image.</p>
