<p>We like to work with non-profit and for-profit <strong>environmentally</strong> &amp; <strong>socially engaged companies</strong>. We understand the budget challenges that come along with being a social enterprise. Aforementioned companies do get a <strong>decent price reduction</strong>, thatâ€™s good for you, and for our Karma.</p>
